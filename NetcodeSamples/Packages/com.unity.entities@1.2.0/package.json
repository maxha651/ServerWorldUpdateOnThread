    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Document counterintuitive behavior when an `EntityQueryMask` is created from an `EntityQuery` that includes a `WithNone<T>()` constraint, where `T` is an `IEnableableComponent`.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Performance improvements in `LocalToWorldSystem` when processing entities with non-dirty hierarchies and no children.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* `EntityManager.CopyEntities()` is now deprecated, and will be removed from the public API in a future package release. We're not aware of any use cases for this function outside of the Entities package itself; `EntityManager.Instantiate()` is the correct way for higher-level code to instantiate copies of existing entities.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* BakingAnalytics no longer initializes TypeManager [InitializeOnLoad]\n* Fixed issue where breakpoints in jobs defined after systems with SystemAPI usage are not hit.\n* Fixed an error where the Entities Hierarchy window was accessing a destroyed world during UI bindings.\n* Using SystemAPI.GetComponentRO/RW with \"using static SystemAPI\" within an Entities.ForEach used to confuse the code generator and failed to compile.\n* Replace `HierarchyNodeMap`'s indexer setter with explicit add/update logic.\n* an issue with hybrid entity baking regarding scales with different signs\n* Entities Hierarchy now removes all nodes of a scene and subscenes when the scene is unloaded.\n* Exception thrown when entering a prefab from the Entities Hierarchy\n* Fixed: Memory leak in certain circumstances in Entity Scene Streaming\n* Improved error message for when `SystemAPI.QueryBuilder` users forget to call `.Build()`.\n* An assert when using AddMultipleComponentsDuringStructuralChange with more than 10 entities in some cases\n* Add filter button was not showing filters in Archetypes and Journaling windows.\n* An invalid range check caused the removal of entities from the hierarchy view to sometimes fail in perfectly valid cases."
